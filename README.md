# Install and Run

```bash
yarn # install
yarn dev # run locally
yarn test # run tests
```

# Components

Components are placed in `src/components` directory. Each component has its own directory with the following structure:

```
-- components
  |-- ComponentName
    |-- index.tsx
-- styles
  |-- ComponentName
    |-- ComponentName.scss
```

ComponentName.scss is the style file for the component and
it is imported in the index.tsx file.
Still, this is a small project so it is preferred to use inline styles.
